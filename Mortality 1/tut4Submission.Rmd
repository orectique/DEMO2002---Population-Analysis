The above plot presents the number of survivors at a certain age in Canada, relative to the initial value of 10000. It is observed that from the mid 20th century, there is a marked decrease in the number of the juvenile deaths - i.e. more persons survive past childhood. Additionally, it is seen that the individual plots gradually shift right, indicating an improvement in general life expectancy.
